-Your IRC client will have to support multiple windows showing different channels simultaneously. 
-Private chats should also be shown in separate windows. 
-There should also be a separate window for showing the list of available channels (should only be shown when the user requests it.)

-The windows showing a chat channel need to have a list of users shown in some way, 
-and it should be possible to bring up a pop up window through right clicking in this list. The pop up menu should then give access to the most common tasks that a user would want to perform against a user in this list.

-The participant list should be sorted in such a way that those with the most rights is at the top of the list, 
for users with the same set of privileges the list should be sorted alphabetically.

-In the IRC client main window there should be an overview of the channel windows 
(possibly organized as the program bar in the windows environment) that makes it easy to switch between the different channels. 
-Clicking on a channel that does not have the focus should bring that channel to the front. 
-Clicking on a focused channel should minimize that channels window.

-The user should be able to maintain a list of the different servers/networks 
-(and it should be possible to import the list of servers/networks that accompany the mIRC IRC client ( http://www.mirc.co.uk )) 
-The user should be allowed to enter their details like name, username and other information needed to connect to an IRC server. 
Make sure that last used settings are stored so that it is set as default when starting the client.

 -The user should also be able to define the color/font/size and so on for the different types of messages 
 (ie pure text, private message, status messages and so on.)
 -The users preferences should be stored as preferences on the system 
 while you can decide for yourself how you would like to store the list of servers/networks.
